Plant stress : -  When plants are subjected to less than ideal growing conditions, they are considered to be under stress.
                  Stress factors can affect growth, survival and crop yields.
                  Plant stress research looks at the response of plants to limitations and excesses of the main abiotic factors (light, temperature, water and nutrients), and of other stress factors that are important in particular situations (e.g. pests, pathogens, or pollutants)
